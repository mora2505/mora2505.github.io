<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
posted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2012</time>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excitedabout a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous
vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
set to the target temperature of the food. In
his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
poaching</q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide
Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve
a seat at the chef table, contact us before
November 30.</p>
